# SRGAN
Superâ€‘Resolution using a Generative Adversarial Network. 
In this project we have looked into different architectures for image super resolution
and compare the models on the dataset that we have used to train and
test the algorithms. By using Tensorflow and Keras framework, we are able to
obtain a working code with the help of some references. The algorithm we used
has a pixel accuracy of roughly 95% and we were able to get favourable outcomes
for most of the cases. By further trying new models we can compare and deduce
which architecture has the best result. All the models were trained on the BSD100 dataset using tensorflow for 150
epochs.
